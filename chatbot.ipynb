       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What is AI agent?\" Let me start by breaking down the term. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, so an AI agent would be an entity that uses AI. But I need to be precise here. An AI agent is a computer system that can perceive its environment through sensors and actuators, and then perform actions to achieve specific goals.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should explain the components first. Perception and action are key here. So, the agent takes in information from the environment, processes it, and then decides on an action. That\\'s the basic cycle: sense, think, act. \\n\\nI should mention that AI agents can be simple or complex. Simple ones might be like a thermostat that turns heating on or off based on temperature. More complex examples could be chatbots, self-driving cars, or recommendation systems like those on Netflix or Amazon.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s important to note the types of AI agents. There are different categories based on their problem-solving approaches. For instance, a reflex agent acts based on current perceptions, a model-based agent uses a model of the environment to predict outcomes, and a utility-based agent considers the best action based on maximizing some utility function. Goal-based agents aim to achieve specific goals. Maybe I should list these types briefly.\\n\\nApplications are crucial here. The user might want to know real-world uses. So examples like chatbots (like Siri or Alexa), recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and even game-playing AI like AlphaGo. These examples make it concrete for the user.\\n\\nI should also touch on the capabilities. AI agents can handle tasks that require learning from data, decision-making under uncertainty, adapting to new information, and interacting with the environment. But I need to clarify that they are limited by their programming and data. They follow the instructions given, so ethical considerations are part of their design.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should start with a simple definition first before diving into details. Let me structure this step by step. Start with a definition, then break down the components (perception, action, goal), explain the types, give examples, and then talk about applications and considerations.\\n\\nAlso, the user might be confused between an AI agent and an AI system in general. An agent is more about the autonomous entity that acts within an environment. So distinguishing that from broader AI concepts is important.\\n\\nI should also mention that AI agents can be rule-based or use machine learning. So some agents follow predefined rules, while others learn from data. That adds another layer of complexity to their types.\\n\\nHmm, maybe include a basic structure: an agent has a performance measure (how well it\\'s doing), environment, actuators, sensors. So the agent\\'s goal is to maximize its performance measure by interacting with the environment.\\n\\nWait, I need to make sure I\\'m not getting too technical. The user might be a beginner, so I should explain terms like sensors and actuators in simple terms. Sensors are like the inputs the agent receives, and actuators are the actions it can take.\\n\\nAlso, contrasting with non-AI agents? Maybe not necessary here. Just focus on the key points.\\n\\nLet me outline the structure:\\n\\n1. Definition of AI agent.\\n2. Key components: sensors, actuators, processing (sense, think, act).\\n3. Types of AI agents (simple reflex, model-based, utility-based, learning agents, etc.).\\n4. Examples of AI agents in real life.\\n5. Applications and uses.\\n6. Capabilities and limitations.\\n7. Ethical considerations or design aspects.\\n\\nThat seems comprehensive. Let me ensure I cover each part without getting too jargon-heavy. Use clear examples. Maybe start with an everyday example like a thermostat to make it relatable.\\n\\nAlso, mention that AI agents can operate in virtual environments (like chatbots) or real-world environments (like robots). They can be software or hardware-based.\\n\\nWait, the user might be confused between an AI agent and an AI model. The agent is the entity that uses the model to take actions. The model is the part that processes data, but the agent is the whole system that acts.\\n\\nAlright, putting it all together in a clear, step-by-step explanation without assuming prior knowledge. Use simple language and examples to illustrate each point. Make sure to highlight the autonomy and goal-directed behavior of AI agents.\\n</think>\\n\\nAn **AI agent** is a computer system or program designed to perceive its environment through sensors (or data inputs), process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. It operates autonomously, making decisions based on its programming and the data it receives. Here\\'s a detailed breakdown:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Components of an AI Agent**\\n1. **Sensors/Inputs**:  \\n   - The agent gathers information from its environment (e.g., cameras, microphones, data streams, or user inputs).  \\n   - Example: A self-driving car uses sensors like cameras and LiDAR to \"see\" the road.\\n\\n2. **Processing/Decision-Making**:  \\n   - The AI analyzes the data to determine the best action. This involves algorithms, machine learning models, or predefined rules.  \\n   - Example: A chatbot processes user questions to generate responses.\\n\\n3. **Actuators/Actions**:  \\n   - The agent performs an action to achieve its goal. This could be physical (e.g., a robot arm moving) or digital (e.g., sending an email, recommending a movie).\\n\\n4. **Goal/Optimization**:  \\n   - Every AI agent has an objective, such as maximizing profit, minimizing errors, or completing a task efficiently.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Types of AI Agents**\\nDifferent agents use varying strategies to achieve their goals:\\n1. **Simple Reflex Agent**:  \\n   - Acts based solely on current inputs without considering history.  \\n   - Example: A thermostat turning on/off based on temperature.\\n\\n2. **Model-Based Agent**:  \\n   - Uses a \"model\" of the environment to predict outcomes before acting.  \\n   - Example: A weather prediction system forecasting rain to suggest carrying an umbrella.\\n\\n3. **Utility-Based Agent**:  \\n   - Chooses actions that maximize a predefined \"utility function.\"  \\n   - Example: A recommendation system prioritizing movies a user is likely to enjoy.\\n\\n4. **Learning Agent**:  \\n   - Adapts and improves over time through experience (e.g., machine learning).  \\n   - Example: A spam filter that learns to identify new types of spam emails.\\n\\n5. **Goal-Based Agent**:  \\n   - Focuses on achieving specific goals (e.g., solving a puzzle, reaching a destination).  \\n   - Example: A navigation app finding the shortest route to a destination.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Real-World Examples of AI Agents**\\n- **Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant (process voice commands and respond).  \\n- **Self-Driving Cars**: Perceive road conditions and adjust speed/steering.  \\n- **Chatbots**: Customer service bots (e.g., on websites) that answer questions.  \\n- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix or Amazon suggesting products based on behavior.  \\n- **Game Bots**: AI opponents in video games (e.g., chess engines like Deep Blue).  \\n- **Industrial Robots**: Automating manufacturing tasks using sensors and actuators.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Applications**\\nAI agents are used in:\\n- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases, managing patient records, or surgical robots.  \\n- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, or credit scoring.  \\n- **Customer Service**: Handling inquiries 24/7 via chatbots.  \\n- **Entertainment**: Personalized content recommendations or AI-driven art creation.  \\n- **Logistics**: Optimizing supply chains or delivery routes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Capabilities & Limitations**\\n- **Strengths**:  \\n  - Can process vast amounts of data quickly.  \\n  - Operate 24/7 without fatigue.  \\n  - Handle repetitive or dangerous tasks (e.g., disaster response robots).  \\n\\n- **Limitations**:  \\n  - Relies on the quality of data and programming.  \\n  - May lack understanding of context or ethics (e.g., bias in facial recognition).  \\n  - Requires ongoing maintenance and updates.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Ethical Considerations**\\n- **Bias and Fairness**: Agents can inherit biases from training data.  \\n- **Privacy**: Collecting data (e.g., voice assistants) raises privacy concerns.  \\n- **Accountability**: Determining responsibility if an agent makes a harmful decision (e.g., self-driving car accidents).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Takeaway**\\nAn AI agent is a self-contained system designed to \"act intelligently\" in its environment. Its effectiveness depends on how well it perceives, processes, and acts to achieve its goals. From simple thermostats to complex autonomous systems, these agents are shaping industries and daily life by automating tasks and improving decision-making.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1811, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1825, 'completion_time': 4.479202488, 'prompt_time': 0.002947499, 'queue_time': 0.24357816200000001, 'total_time': 4.482149987}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_98b01f25b2', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--cdd9b70d-8269-4f4d-96e4-89c2ef9ff415-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1811, 'total_tokens': 1825})"

       "AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'Okay, the user is asking \"What is ai agent\". Let me break this down. They want to understand the concept of an AI agent. First, I need to define what an AI agent is. Since I might not remember all the details, I should use the tools provided to get accurate information.\\n\\nLooking at the available tools: arxiv, wikipedia, and tavily_search_results_json. Wikipedia could be a good start because it often has clear explanations of concepts. The arXiv function might give research papers, which could be too technical. Tavily\\'s search results might provide a variety of sources, but Wikipedia is more likely to have a straightforward definition.\\n\\nSo I\\'ll start with the Wikipedia function. The parameter is \"query\", so I\\'ll set the query to \"AI agent\" or maybe \"Artificial intelligence agent\". Let me check if \"AI agent\" is the exact term used in Wikipedia. If not, maybe \"intelligent agent\" is the proper term. Hmm, maybe \"agent (computing)\" could be another term. To be safe, I\\'ll use \"AI agent\" as the query and see if that brings up the right page. If not, perhaps the function will handle redirection or the response will give me more clues.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"AI agent\" is commonly referred to in the context of AI, so the Wikipedia entry might exist. Let me proceed with the Wikipedia tool first. The function call would be {\"name\": \"wikipedia\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"AI agent\"}}. \\n\\nWait, but sometimes the exact term might not be there, so maybe \"artificial intelligence agent\" is better. Let me adjust the query to \"Artificial intelligence agent\". That might be more precise. Alternatively, \"agent (computing)\" might cover it. Hmm, perhaps the user\\'s term is more general. Let me go with \"AI agent\" first. If that doesn\\'t work, the tool might still find a related page. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using Tavily\\'s search results would give more comprehensive info from various sources, but since the user just wants a definition, Wikipedia is probably sufficient.
